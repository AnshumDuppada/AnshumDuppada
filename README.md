### Hi there  ðŸ‘‹
### :dizzy::dizzy:I am a Data Analytics student :book: with experience in handling Sybase databases. :dizzy::dizzy:


### Working with databases and processing large amounts of data had piqued my attention, and I decided to switch careers from pure programming to data analytics. 
### Data's power can be observed now on all platforms, even unstructured and unclean data, which can provide insights. Machines are also learning human behaviour with the use of this data, which is the future and is conceivable due to the abundance of data available.   
### I am currently looking for an opportunity that will allow me to develop myself in the field of data analytics. :running:. Thank you for taking the time to look over my profile!!!! :smile:
