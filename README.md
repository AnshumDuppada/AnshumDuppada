### Hi there  ðŸ‘‹

### Working with the databases and handling huge amount of data had amused me a lot, which interested me to change my career path from pure programming to Data analytics. 
### Power of data can be seen nowadays on all the platforms, such as unstructured and unclean data is capable of providing insights. Also, with the help of this data, machines are learning human behaviour which is the future and is possible because of loads of information out there.
